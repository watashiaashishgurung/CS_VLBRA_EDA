The following analysis focuses on the cybercrime incidents reported in Vlaams-Brabant over the last decade (2014-2024). The data provided visualizes trends on a Radiant graph and includes monthly incident counts.

### Overview of Findings

Based on the data and the provided graph, here are the key insights:

1. **Peak Activity (October - December)**:
   - **Highest incident rates** are seen in the months of **October, November, and December**, which aligns with the end-of-year rush and higher online activity. Incidents sharply increase during this period, which could correlate with the rise in e-commerce, holiday shopping, and year-end financial transactions.
   - **November** is particularly noteworthy for its sharp spike, as seen in both the radiant chart and data records.

2. **Moderate Activity (July - August)**:
   - There is a **mid-year increase** in incidents, especially in **June and July**. This may be attributed to travel-related cybercrimes or mid-year financial frauds.
   - These months show steady but not extreme levels of cybercrime compared to the end of the year.

3. **Early-Year Decline (January - April)**:
   - The **first quarter of the year** (January through April) consistently shows a lower number of incidents. This period appears to have the **lowest activity** compared to other months. This post-holiday dip in cybercrime activity might result from less online shopping or decreased general cyber activity.
